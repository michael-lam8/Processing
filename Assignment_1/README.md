# Assignment 1
This Processing program contains math questions - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - for the user to answer, as well as a Pong replica.

## Running the Application
If Processing and/or the Interfascia library is not installed on the computer, follow the instructions corresponding to your operating system to avoid manual installation:

### Windows
Open the "Windows Executable (XX-bit)" folder based on your operating system type. This can be found by going to Control Panel > System and Security > System. For example, if you are running a 64-bit operating system, open the "Windows Executable (64-bit)" folder. Run Assignment_1.exe within that folder.

Note that users running a 32-bit version of Windows will need to manually [install Java version 8 or later](https://java.com/en/download/).

### macOS
Recent versions of macOS introduced the [Gatekeeper system](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202491) for security, preventing users from running downloaded applications that may potentially contain malware.

To run this application, open the "macOS Application" folder, Control-click or right-click Assignment_1.app, then select Open from the popup menu. Click Open once more in the dialog box.

## Running the Code
To examine and/or make changes to the code, [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) is required. Download and install the version corresponding to your operating system.

To run the code from Processing, the Interfascia library must be installed.
To install Interfascia, follow the following steps:
1. Open Processing
2. Go to Sketch > Import Library > Add Library...
3. Under the Libraries tab, search for Interfascia
4. Click Install
