# Assignment 1
### This Processing program contains math questions - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - for the user to answer, as well as a Pong replica.

If Processing and/or the Interfascia library is not installed on the computer, run Assignment_1.exe in one of the "Executable Version (XX-bit)" folders (corresponding to the OS version) to avoid manually installing them. This executable file is only runnable on Windows.
